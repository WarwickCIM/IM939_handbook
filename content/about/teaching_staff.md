Agent-based Modelling, Computational Modelling for Public Policy, Network Analysis, and Participatory Research Methods are my areas of research interest and expertise. I continue to work at the intersection of academic research and public policy through which I see firsthand the impact of reliable data analysis and effective story telling using data on decision-making.

My research falls under the broad area that can be referred to as Visual Data Science and focuses on designing visualisations, interactions and computational methods to enable an effective combination of human and machine capabilities to facilitate data-intensive problem solving.
I have a special interest in working on problems where high-dimensional, spatio-temporal, heterogenous and large datasets are used in answering questions with data.
