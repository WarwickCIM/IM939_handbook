My research falls under the broad area that can be referred to as Visual Data Science and focuses on designing visualisations, interactions and computational methods to enable an effective combination of human and machine capabilities to facilitate data-intensive problem solving.
I have a special interest in working on problems where high-dimensional, spatio-temporal, heterogenous and large datasets are used in answering questions with data.

#### Carlos Cámara-Menoyo

<img src="../../media/staff-carlos.png" class="img-fluid" align="right" width="150"/> *Senior Research Software Engineer*

I am a versatile, transdisciplinary, and passionate person with a mixed technical and sociological background. As a Senior Research Software Engineer, I am responsible to support research and teaching by using and developing research software while promoting an open, reproducible research culture and outputs.
