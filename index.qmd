## What this module is about?

This module introduces students to the fundamental techniques, concepts and contemporary discussions across the broad field of data science. With data and data related artefacts becoming ubiquitous in all aspects of social life, data science gains access to new sources of data, is taken up across an expanding range of research fields and disciplines, and increasingly engages with societal challenges. The module provides an advanced introduction to the theoretical and scientific frameworks of data science, and to the fundamental techniques for working with data using appropriate procedures, algorithms and visualisation. Students learn how to critically approach data and data-driven artefacts, and engage with and critically reflect on contemporary discussions around the practice of data science, its compatibility with different analytics frameworks and disciplinary, and its relation to on-going digital transformations of society. As well as lectures discussing the theoretical, scientific and ethical frameworks of data science, the module features coding labs and workshops that expose students to the practice of working effectively with data, algorithms, and analytical techniques, as well as providing a platform for reflective and critical discussions on data science practices, resulting data artefacts and how they can be interpreted, actioned and influence society.

## Course contents

### Introduction and historical perspectives ([Chapter -@sec-session-1])

This week discusses data science as a field that cuts across disciplines and provides a historical perspective on the subject. We discuss the terms Data Science and Data Scientists, reflect on examples of Data Science projects, and discuss the research process at a methodological level.

###  Thinking Data: Theoretical and Practical Concerns

This week explores the cultural, ethical, and critical challenges posed by data artefacts and data-intensive scientific processes. Engaging with Critical Data Studies, we discuss issues around data capture, curation, data quality, inclusion/exclusion and representativeness. The session also discusses the different kinds of data that one can encounter across disciplines, the underlying characteristics of data and how we can analytically and practically approach data quality issues and the challenge of identifying and curating appropriate data sets.

This handbook has been created by Carlos Cámara-Menoyo and Cagatay Turkay, based on the materials from previous years created by Cagatay Turkay and James Tripp.

## Table of contents

Currently, this book is replicating the existing structure consiting of one repo for sessions (Cagatay's repo) and another one for labs' content (James) by mapping each repo into two different sections: Sessions and Labs.

### Proposed table of contents

However, I suspect, though, that if we proceed with the handbook, the structure should be based on units/weeks, and every unit should contain both, the session and the labs

```         
- 1: Introduction, Historical Perspectives & Basic Concepts
    - Session
    - Labs
- 2: Thinking data
    - Session (probably on the root?)
    - Labs
...
```
