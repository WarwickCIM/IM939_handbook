    "## Explanations (from the source)\n",
    "+ Gender pay gap (GPG) - calculated as the difference between average hourly earnings (excluding overtime) of men and women as a proportion of average hourly earnings (excluding overtime) of men. For example, a 4% GPG denotes that women earn 4% less, on average, than men. Conversely, a -4% GPG denotes that women earn 4% more, on average, than men.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Mean: a measure of the average which is derived by summing the values for a given sample, and then dividing the sum by the number of observations (i.e. jobs) in the sample. In earnings distributions, the mean can be disproportionately influenced by a relatively small number of high-paying jobs.\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "+ Median: the value below which 50% of jobs fall. It is ONS's preferred measure of average earnings as it is less affected by a relatively small number of very high earners and the skewed distribution of earnings. It therefore gives a better indication of typical pay than the mean.\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "### Coverage and timeliness\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "The Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) covers employee jobs in the United Kingdom. It does not cover the self-employed, nor does it cover employees not paid during the reference period (2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "GPG estimates are provided for the pay period that included a specified date in April. They relate to employees on adult rates of pay, whose earnings for the survey pay period were not affected by absence. \n",
    "\t\n",
    "ASHE is based on a 1% sample of jobs taken from HM Revenue and Customs' Pay As You Earn (PAYE) records. Consequently, individuals with more than one job may appear in the sample more than once.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t "

But you can collate a longitudinal view should you wish to. E.g., by downloading the zip folders across the desired years and collating the information for desired categories for multiple years. But remember that this will be a 'simplified approach' to a longitudinal view and will have limitations. Also, recollect one of the figures Cagatay showed in the earlier lectures - it's common to spend a lot of time at the start of your Data Science project just collating the necessary information. If you fancy, you can write a script to automate the data collation process!\n",
