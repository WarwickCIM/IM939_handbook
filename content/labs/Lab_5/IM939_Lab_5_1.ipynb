    "# Lab: Working with multiple models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will look at the London Borough data that we already encountered when we worked with the London Borough profiles and the Borough Cards that we utilised in the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have a look at the data through this online tool provided by GLA: https://data.london.gov.uk/london-area-profiles/\n",
    "\n",
    "However, unlike the data that we explored during the session, this data set has several features (i.e., columns or variables), 76 of them to be precise.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we would like to do in this notebook is to make use of a dimension reduction algorithm -- Multidimensial Scaling -- to help us create various different \"spaces\". Each of these space will be a different way of \"seeing this data\" and if we adopt the language from Scott Page, they will have different \"attentions\". \n",
    "\n",
    "What the following exercise will do is to walk you through the variables of this data set through a few visualisations. It will then create a few different projections and will give them some names. What we expect you to do is to create your own projections and try to interpret them. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to be reminded of what MDS is, you can have a look at the slides from last week. In a super tiny nutshell, MDS tries to create a space where \"real\" distances in the data are preserved as much as possible while \"projecting\" the data elements on a lower dimensional space. For instance, the following is from the slide deck:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/mds.png\" alt=\"An MDS plot of cities.\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "What we see here are a few cities that would normally \"exist\" in our 3-dimensional world and the distances between them would normally be on this spherical coordinate system. But we create here is a 2D map and the distances between cities are preserved as much as possible. Near cities in the world are closer, and the further ones are further but not as accurate as it is in the world. The dimensions here carry no real meaning it is the distances that will \"tell a story\" (if there is one).\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, let's get on with the data now.\n"
