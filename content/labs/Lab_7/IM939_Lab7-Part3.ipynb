    "• Gender pay gap (GPG) - calculated as the difference between average hourly earnings (excluding overtime) of men and women as a proportion of average hourly earnings (excluding overtime) of men. For example, a 4% GPG denotes that women earn 4% less, on average, than men. Conversely, a -4% GPG denotes that women earn 4% more, on average, than men.\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "• Mean - a measure of the average which is derived by summing the values for a given sample, and then dividing the sum by the number of observations (i.e. jobs) in the sample. In earnings distributions, the mean can be disproportionately influenced by a relatively small number of high-paying jobs.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "• Median - the value below which 50% of jobs fall. It is ONS's preferred measure of average earnings as it is less affected by a relatively small number of very high earners and the skewed distribution of earnings. It therefore gives a better indication of typical pay than the mean.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",

    "ASHE covers employee jobs in the United Kingdom. It does not cover the self-employed, nor does it cover employees not paid during the reference period.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "GPG estimates are provided for the pay period that included a specified date in April. They relate to employees on adult rates of pay, whose earnings for the survey pay period were not affected by absence. Estimates for 2020 include employees who have been furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "ASHE is based on a 1% sample of jobs taken from HM Revenue and Customs' Pay As You Earn (PAYE) records. Consequently, individuals with more than one job may appear in the sample more than once.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "#### Quality measures\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "The colour coding within the tables indicates the quality of each estimate and is based upon the coefficient of variation (CV) values for the corresponding male and female earnings estimates. The CV is the ratio of the standard error of an estimate to the estimate itself and is expressed as a percentage. The smaller the CV the greater the accuracy of the estimate. The colour coding for the GPG estimates is derived as follows:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "• If the CV values of both the male and female earnings estimates are less than or equal to 5% then the GPG estimate is considered good quality.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "• If the CV value of either (or both) the male or female earnings estimate is greater than 5% and less than or equal to 10% (and the CV of the other estimate is less than or equal to 10%) then the GPG estimate is considered reasonable quality.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "• If the CV value of either (or both) the male or female earnings estimate is greater than 10% and less than or equal to 20% (and the CV of the other estimate is less than or equal to 20%) then the GPG estimate is considered lower quality and should be used with caution.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "• If the CV value of at least one of the earnings estimates is greater than 20% then the GPG estimate is considered unreliable for practical purposes and is suppressed. "
