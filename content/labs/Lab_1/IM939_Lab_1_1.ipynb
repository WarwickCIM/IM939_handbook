    "# Lab: Introduction to Python {#sec-intro}\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first Python lab. Our aim is to introduce a little bit of Python and help you be comfortable with using Jupyter notebooks. No previous knowledge is assumed and questions are encouraged!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technological stack {#sec-technological-stack}\n",
    "\n",
    "This module uses a combination of different technologies (technological stack) besides python. You will need to be familiar with all their components to follow the labs as well as the assignments. You can find a brief description of the main components below, and you can refer to @sec-setup for a more technical explanation of the setup.\n",

    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a very popular general purpose programming language. Data scientists use it to clean up, analyse and visualise data. A major strength of python is that the core Python functionality can be extended using libraries. In future labs, you will learn about popular data science libraries such as pandas and numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to think of programming languages as a structured way to tell the computer what to do. We cover some of the basic features of Python in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "[Anaconda](https://anaconda.com)[^anaconda] is a _distribution platform_ that manages and installs many tools used in data science, such as _programming languages_ (python), _libraries_, _IDEs_[^ides]... as well as a _GUI_ (Anaconda navigator) and a _CLI_ (Anaconda interpreter). Anaconda does some other useful things, such as creating isolated _virtual environments_, which we will be using for this module. \n",
    "\n",
    "[^ides]: Some specific  Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for Python included in Anaconda are [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Jupyterlab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html) and [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/). In this module, there's no preferred IDE (actually, different members of the staff use different IDEs) and you can use the one you are more familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: callout-tip\n",
    "\n",
    "### Virtual environments\n",
    "\n",
    "_Virtual environments_ are a way to install all the dependencies (and their right version) required for a certain project by isolating python and libraries' specific versions. Every person who recreatesthe virtual environment will be using the same packages and versions, reducing errors and increasing reproducibility.\n",
    "While they are considered an advanced practice, and are therefore out of scope of this course, you may want to learn about Python's environments here: <https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/>\n",

    "### Jupter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), such as this one, allow you to combine text and code into documents you can edit in the browser. The power of these notebooks is in documenting or describing what you are doing with the code alongside that code. For example, you could detail why you chose a particular clustering algorithm above the clustering code itself. In other words, it add narrative and helps clarify your workflow.\n",

    "As we saw at [this unit in the Skills Programme](https://pages.github.warwick.ac.uk/CIM-Methods/coding_skills/content/computational_skills/computational_thinking.html#sec-data-types), programming languages use types to help them understand what a piece of data might represent. Knowing how data types work is important because they define what can be done and cannot be done with them. Each programming language has different data types which can be extended by other libraries such as Pandas, but these are some of the most frequent ones (and the ones we will be facing more frequently).\n",
